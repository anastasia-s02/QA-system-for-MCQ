While classical music follows formal European tradition,jazz is rather a free form. It is full of energy,expressing the moods,interests,and emotions of the people. It is breaking and exciting with a modern sound. In the 1920s jazz sounded like America. And so it does today.\\nThe origins of the music are as interesting as the music itself. Jazz was invented by American Negroes,or blacks,as they are called today,who were brought to the southern states as slaves. They were sold to farm owners and forced to work long hours in the cotton and tobacco fields. This work was hard and life was short. When a Negro died his friends and  s would gather and carry the body to have a ceremony before they buried him.\\nThere was always a band with them. On the way to the ceremony the band played slowly,solemn music suitable for the situation. But on the way home the mood changed. Spirits lifted. Everyone was happy. Death had removed one of their members,but the living were glad to be alive. The band played happy music. This music made everyone want to dance. It was an early form of jazz.\\nMusic has always been important in Negro life. The black,who were brought to American from West Africa,had a rich musical tradition.

Few large animals have got used to life in the desert because their size makes it difficult to find shelter from the heat and they can't store water.\\nIn order to survive, desert animals have developed a number of ways to live in their special habitat. The most common way is staying under plants or rocks or digging underground in the heat of the day.

They do not have sweat glands  and pass only small amount of waste water.\\nSome animals develop their own ways of surviving in deserts. The Thorny Devil is a kind of lizard that lives in Australian desert areas. It has a body that channels raindrops directly into its mouth when it rains. Water-holding frogs spend most of the year underground in Australian desert areas, and develop a sort of cocoon that enables them to store water to keep them going through the dry times.

He fell down from the roof of a house when Clara was just 11 years old. She stayed by his side and looked after him for three years, learning how to give him all his medicines.\\nWhen the Civil War began in 1861, she immediately recognized that the poorly equipped soldiers needed help.

She also read to the soldiers and wrote letters for them.\\nAfter the Battle of Cedar Mountain in northern Virginia in 1862, Clara arrived at a field hospital at midnight with a vehicle full of supplies. A doctor named Paul Smith at that hospital would later write, \"I thought heaven had sent out an angel that night -- her assistance arrived at exactly the right time.\"\\nIn 1869, Clara went to Europe and learned about the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Many seem unable to get through an e-mail or Instant Message chat sentence without using one. Some feel that they add feeling and character to otherwise cold digital communications.\\nSome people, such as a Hollywood scriptwriter John Blumenthal, however, _ the use of emoticons as \"infantile just like the people who use them\". He believes that words themselves should be enough. \"If you\\'re funny, happy or sad, that should be apparent from the comment that goes before the emoticons,\" he argues.\\nIn the eyes of Blumenthal, the use of emoticons is a gender issue. \"Men don\\'t use emoticons very much. Maybe not at all,\" he said, \"Teenage girls and women seem to use them a lot. Maybe there\\'s an emoticon gene.\"\\nIt\\'s an interesting opinion, but it is not shared by all.\\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Dacher Keltner, professor of psychology at the University of California, said that emoticons are popular because our brains are programmed \"to seek out representations of humanity\". He believes that they are popular not because they are shortcuts for the lazy, but because they bring in something beyond language. They satisfy our needs to be with and communicate with people.\\nAll of these arguments may be somehow right. Each one of us will choose to communicate in our own way. I tried to use one once and felt like I was stealing into a primary school class that I had no place being in. I\\'d rather let my words do the talking.\\nFriends, however, send me messages and e-mails full of emoticons. I have no problem with this. I don\\'t regard any of my friends as lazy or immature.
